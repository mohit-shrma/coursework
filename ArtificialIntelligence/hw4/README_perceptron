Steps to run :
1. make sure python2.7 (2.6 may also work) is installed on system with numpy library integrated. I tried it in gradlabs 'strongbad' mac  machine and it works perfectly.
2. on shell run:
      python2.7 perceptron.py

This program uses perceptron algorithm to classify the data. It uses sigmoid function as hypothesis function and runs gradient descent algorithm to update the weights i.e theta or fitting parameters.
It also calculates cost which can be uncommented in program for display.
