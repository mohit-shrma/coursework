Steps to run the program:
1.) Make sure matlab is installed on machine, and it's under PATH of the system.
2.) Run from shell matlab -nodisplay -r 'SmoothHMM(<input evidence length>, [<evidence vector>])' e.g. matlab -nodisplay -r 'SmoothHMM(10, [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1])'.

This program compute the smoothing estimates for the given evidence sequence.
