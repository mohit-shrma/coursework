Steps to run the program:
1.) Make sure matlab is installed on machine, and it's under PATH of the system.
2.) Run from shell matlab -nodisplay -r 'GibbsRain(<num steps>)' e.g. matlab -nodisplay -r 'GibbsRain(1000)'.

This program first compute p(C|R,S=T,W=T) and p(R|C,S=T,W=T) and then uses
gibbs sampler to sample using subroutine 'GibbsSampler'. which takes
cpt table for p(R|C,S=T,W=T) and p(C|R,S=T,W=T) and number of steps to sample
as argument.
After sampling then from the samples it computes p(R|S=T,W=T).
