cd FisherDiscNGenerativ
To run diagFisher e.g. : >> testError = diagFisher(Iris,10);
To run fisher e.g. : >> testError = fisher(Iris,10);


cd NaiveBayesNLogistic
To run logistic regression e.g:  logisticRegression(Pima,100,[5 10 15 20 25 30])
To run naive bayes e.g:  naiveBayesGaussian(Pima,100,[5 10 15 20 25 30])

I have copied all the matlab files needed for running the codes. In case any file is found to be missing do please let me know as I am new to matlab I didn't know that you can write functions in same file. Do let me know if any of file is missing.
