cd boostingNTrees
To run mydstump e.g. : >> myDstump('Mushroom.mat', depth, numFolds);
To run myDtree e.g. : >> myDtree('Mushroom.mat', depth, numFolds);
To run adaboost e.g. : >> myAdaBoost('Mushroom.mat', numberOfStumps, numFolds);
To run logitboost e.g. : >> myLogitBoost('Mushroom.mat', numberOfStumps, numFolds);

myDstump2 is my old implementation, i included just for the sake to check the separate code which i previously implemented. in new code i redirect all to mydtree.m

I have copied all the matlab files needed for running the codes. In case any file is found to be missing do please let me know as I am new to matlab I didn't know that you can write functions in same file. Do let me know if any of file is missing.
