Steps to run the program:
1.) Make sure matlab is installed on machine, and it's under PATH of the system.
2.) Run from shell matlab -nodisplay -r 'lwUmbrella(numSamples, numSteps, evidence)' e.g. matlab -nodisplay -r 'lwUmbrella(100, 10, [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0])'.

This program gives the probability estimates using likelihood weighting for the given number of samples, given number of steps and evidence sequence.
