Steps to run the program:
1.) Make sure matlab is installed on machine, and it's under PATH of the system.
2.) Run from shell matlab -nodisplay -r 'tpUmbrella(evidence)' e.g. matlab -nodisplay -r 'tpUmbrella([ 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0])'.

This program gives the probability estimates using forward filtering for the given evidence sequence.
